**Notes on Linux Support**

The ability to call the coe-cli executable in a Linux environment is here for reference. Currently, the ALM Accelerator Pipelines require Windows runners due to several packages we use that are windows only. We are actively working toward support for Linux environments, but as of the time of this addition this is for reference only.
